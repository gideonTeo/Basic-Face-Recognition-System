# Face-Recognition
This face recognition project is just a basic prototype which will be later on modified and used in my upcoming project Sense+. It's not the best face recognition code you can find on git but okay.

# Prerequisites
- PyCharm
- a functioning web camera 
- Python packages (CV2, numpy & face_recognition) 

# Installing 
- install python packages through pip3 on terminal / command prompt

# Running the tests
For face_rec_wNames.py:
  Replace the image file name. If error occurs, it means that the code couldn't recognise your image (can be check via len()).
  Add or remove variables from the list known_face_encodings / known_face_names. Ensure that the variables are in the correct sequence.
